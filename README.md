# ReactLearningCurve

‚ù§Ô∏è Welcome to journey of learning React üôè

I will be documenting my learning react journey in this series.

I'm Aditiya and working as a Front End developer in Boston Consulting Group since 2 years. I'm revising all the skills required for pro frontend developer, so taken this opportunity of learning react by creating Swiggy clone and implementing all major concepts of react. The core concepts, deep knowledge of like why react is fast, how behind the scenes your app is performing, how browser responds to those changes are provided here.

Some important points to be remembered while cloning this respository. Ater successful cloning, please follow below instructions:

I have given path for running app in package.json file inside "scripts", you can change it as per your convenience and run npm run start.
Also you can change port number or remove if app in not running in given port number
If you want to use direct command "npx parcel "to run app, then remove "start" and "build" from "scripts". Just give npx parcel
